### Course Information App

**Description:**  
The Course Information App demonstrates how to display course details using React components. It shows the course title, the names and number of exercises for each course part, and calculates the total number of exercises. This project is ideal for practicing passing props between components in React.

**Key Components:**

- **Header:** Displays the course name as the main title.
- **Part:** Renders details (name and exercises) for a single part of the course.
- **Content:** Aggregates several `Part` components to display all parts of the course.
- **Total:** Calculates and displays the sum of exercises from all parts.
- **App:** Maintains the course data and renders the Header, Content, and Total components.
